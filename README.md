# CMSApi

Hello this is the web api core application kindly make the following changes in appsettings.json file connection string

currently the connection string is like this 

"ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=LAPTOP-P3QC1U4D\\SQLEXPRESS;Database=CMS_DB;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=True"
  }

you need to change Server=LAPTOP-P3QC1U4D\\SQLEXPRESS with you SQL server name.

Thanks.
